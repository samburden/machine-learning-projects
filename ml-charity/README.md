## CharityML Project

This project explores various supervised learning algorithms and attempts to predict if a person's income is above $50,000. This information will help the charity correctly target the best people when seeking donations. This dataset comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). A subset of the data has been used for this project and can be found in the [census.csv](./census.csv) file.

This project is using Python 2.7 and needs the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

These can be installed using pip or conda if using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run using the following from a terminal:

```jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb```
