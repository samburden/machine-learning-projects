## Boston Housing Prices Project

This project explores data about Boston area homes and attempts to predict prices based on various features of the home. This dataset comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). A subset of the data has been used for this project and can be found in the [housing.csv](./housing.csv) file.

This project is using Python 2.7 and needs the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

These can be installed using pip or conda if using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run using the following from a terminal:

```jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb```
