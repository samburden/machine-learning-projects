## Titanic Data Exploration Project

This project explores a dataset about the sinking of the Titanic. Specifically, it contains data about the passengers and attempts to find a pattern in the type of passengers that survived. A subset of the Titanic data has been used for this project and can be found in the [titanic_data.csv](./titanic_data.csv) file.

This project is using Python 2.7 and needs the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

These can be installed using pip or conda if using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run using the following from a terminal:

```jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb```
